LEGAL AND USAGE

IntelTrace is intended for legal OSINT only. Use it only on systems and targets for which you have permission to investigate. The tool intentionally avoids crawling private or protected content and provides placeholders for services (e.g., HIBP) that require API keys and consent.

Developers and users are responsible for adhering to all local laws and organizational policies.
